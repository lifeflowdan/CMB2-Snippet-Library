 * Closes previous repeater row when new row is added.
 * This is a pretty simple one worth mentioning (I hadn't seen it anywhere else). You can easily change which row (or rows) are closed by switching out 'last()'
 * for something else. For example, 'prev()' will close the row before the previous row, and so on. You can also use this logic
 * to create a button allowing end users to close all rows, etc.
